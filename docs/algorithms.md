# Canonical Algorithm Parameters (contract)

Single source of truth for detection/metric parameters. Three implementations follow this table:
`lab/src/wingfoil_lab/*` (tuning ground), `ios/WingFoilKit/Sources/AnalysisEngine/*`
(authoritative), `garmin/source/{detectors,metrics}/*` (live approximation). Defaults get
re-tuned in lab notebooks against the labeled fixture corpus; changed defaults are updated HERE
first, with the tuning notebook referenced in the commit.

`ENGINE_VERSION`: **0.1.0** (bump on any change that alters outputs; triggers phone re-analysis)

## Flight (foil) detection — hysteresis state machine

States: `OFF_FOIL → (entry) → ON_FOIL → (exit) → OFF_FOIL`. A third derived state `PUMPING`
(off-foil + active takeoff attempt) exists for display/record `foil_state` only.

| param | default | units | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `foilEntrySpeed` | 12.0 | km/h | speed ≥ entry … |
| `entryHold` | 2 | s | … sustained this long ⇒ ON_FOIL (flight start backdated to first qualifying sample) |
| `foilExitSpeed` | 8.0 | km/h | speed ≤ exit … |
| `exitHold` | 3 | s | … sustained this long ⇒ OFF_FOIL (flight end backdated to first sub-exit sample) |
| `minFlightDuration` | 5 | s | shorter flights discarded (no lap, not counted) |
| `touchdownMergeGap` | 0 (off) | s | phone-only: merge flights separated by ≤ gap as one flight + touchdown event (v2) |

Prior art anchors: WindsportTracker wingfoil threshold ≈ 9.7 km/h; Surf Tracker run recipe
(9 km/h entry / 6 s / 13 km/h peak). Our entry is higher because takeoff pumping produces
9–12 km/h taxi speeds. User-tunable on watch (GCM settings) and phone; thresholds used are
echoed in session fields 40–42.

## Speed sample hygiene (phone; watch uses quality gate only)

| param | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `maxHdop` | 5.0 | GP3S standard (when channel present) |
| `minSatellites` | 5 | when present |
| `maxAccel1Hz` | 4.0 m/s² | spike filter (Logiqx 1 Hz value) |
| `gapInterpolateMax` | 2 s | linear-interpolate gaps ≤ this; longer ⇒ hard segment break |
| `speedChannelRecords` | doppler | FIT `speed`/`enhanced_speed` (device Doppler) for all speed records |
| `speedChannelManeuvers` | hybrid | positional speed (local-meter projection) for turn minima — Doppler is ~3–4 s smoothed |
| watch gate | `Position.Quality ≥ USABLE` | below ⇒ sample not fed to detectors/records; timers freeze; FIT keeps raw |

## Speed records (GP3S set)

2 s peak · 10 s peak · 5×10 s (mean of best 5 **disjoint** 10 s windows) · 100 m · 250 m ·
500 m · nautical mile (1852 m) · 1 h · alpha 500 · session distance.

| param | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `alphaProximity` | 50 m | endpoint-to-startpoint (Pythagoras on local meters) |
| `alphaMaxDistance` | 500 m | total path length |
| `alphaCandidatePrune` | ≥250 m path AND ≥90° COG spread | gps-wizard optimization |
| `alphaBoundary` | interpolate | fractional samples at window edges (phone only) |
| `hourSearch` | forward + backward | avoids the classic missing-samples bug |
| `minSpeedFilter` | none | GPSResults-style 5 kn floors distort results — never applied |
| watch live set | 2 s, 10 s, 5×10 s, 500 m, NM (flag), alpha-lite | alpha-lite: armed 120 s after a ≥90° turn, 1 Hz two-pointer, `~`-labeled |

## Turn detection & classification

| param | default | units | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `turnMinAngle` | 60 | deg | net unwrapped COG change |
| `turnMaxDuration` | 8 | s | window for the net change |
| `turnPeakRate` | 25 | deg/s | at ≥1 sample (Richterich: jibes ~30–40°/s for ~4 s) |
| `turnContext` | ON_FOIL or ≤3 s after | | turns while swimming don't count |
| `turnCogSpeedFloor` | 2.0 | m/s | COG geometry read only from steps above this (same COAPS caveat as wind); a capsize below it otherwise reads as a multi-turn spin |
| `turnContinueRate` | 5 | deg/s | edge trim: shrink the detected span to the actually-turning part |
| `entrySpeedWindow` | 3 | s | entry speed = max over window before turn start |
| `minSpeedLag` | 2 | s | minimum searched to `turnEnd + lag` (the collapse of a botched turn lands just past the COG sweep) |
| `turnSuccessPct` | 70 | % | success ⇒ minSpeed/entrySpeed ≥ this AND speed never ≤ `foilExitSpeed` |
| `turnStopSpeedFloor` | 1.0 | m/s | "stopped": below this the rider is not making way |
| `turnTouchdownMaxStop` | 3 | s | longest stop still called a touchdown |
| `turnFallStop` | 5 | s | stop longer than this ⇒ fell in |
| `turnOutcomeLookahead` | 5 | s | tail past the COG sweep searched for the loss of foil (a botched exit collapses just after the geometry ends) |
| `turnOutcomeWindow` | 60 | s | cap on following the recovery, so a turn taken before a break does not absorb it |
| classification | | | tack = COG crosses wind axis through upwind; jibe = through downwind; requires wind axis; bear-away/round-up (no axis crossing) excluded from counts |
| port/starboard | | | side before the turn, from sign of TWA |

Entry/minimum speeds come from `speedChannelManeuvers` (positional); the "never dropped off
foil" half of the success test stays on Doppler so it agrees with flight segmentation.
Overlapping candidates are non-maximum-suppressed by net angle, widest sweep wins.

### Turn outcome (primary, rider-facing) — `flew_through` · `touchdown` · `fell_in`

Score%/success stay as the *secondary*, continuous metric: outcome says what happened,
score says what the turn cost. Every turn gets an outcome, bear-aways included.

1. **Lost the foil?** From turn start to `turnOutcomeLookahead` past the sweep, a sample
   counts as flying only when it is inside a flight **and** its Doppler speed is above
   `foilExitSpeed`. No such sample ⇒ `flew_through`. The extra speed test is load-bearing:
   flight exit needs `exitHold` (3 s) of sub-exit speed, so a 1–2 s touchdown — exactly the
   middle case — never breaks the flight and the segments alone would call it a fly-through.
2. **Stopped how long?** The off-foil run is followed until foiling resumes (capped by
   `turnOutcomeWindow`) and the longest contiguous spell below `turnStopSpeedFloor` is
   measured, on `min(Doppler, positional)`. Both channels *over*-read at rest — wrist
   Doppler picks up swim strokes, positional picks up GPS jitter — and neither under-reads,
   so the lower of the two is the better stop evidence, and using both bridges single-sample
   dropouts in either. An interval counts only when both end samples are below the floor and
   no recording gap separates them, the same "hold" convention flight segmentation uses.
3. Spell > `turnFallStop` ⇒ `fell_in`; otherwise `touchdown`, flagged `borderline` when the
   spell exceeds `turnTouchdownMaxStop`.

**The 3–5 s band is kept as two tunables, not collapsed to one threshold.** Over the corpus
(116 detected turns on 2026-08-07 ciq + 2026-08-05 am + 2026-08-04 pm) the measured stops are
0 s for every fly-through and 1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 9, 13, 14, 15, 15, 17, 21, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34,
34 s otherwise: the band holds 2 of 116 turns (1.7 %), so a single threshold anywhere in it
would score almost identically — but those 2 are genuine ambiguities (a rider drifting at
~1 m/s for a minute), and `borderline` surfaces them for review instead of silently deciding.
Collapse the pair only if the flag stays this rare on a larger corpus.

## Wind axis estimation (phone)

1. Foiling samples only, speed ≥ 2 m/s (COG≠heading below that — COAPS caveat).
2. Weighted circular histogram of COG (10° bins, weight = distance) → two dominant modes
   (reaches) → axis = bisector.
3. 180° ambiguity: **no-go zone** — of the two axis ends, the one whose ±45° cone holds
   (almost) no distance is where the wind comes from; margin = relative cone asymmetry
   (`fullMargin` 0.4 ⇒ certain, both cones empty ⇒ unresolved) → else Open-Meteo prior →
   else user value.
4. Confidence ∈ [0,1] = axis confidence (lobe mass × lobe balance × mode separation) ×
   ambiguity margin; `< 0.5` ⇒ turns labeled `turn`, not tack/jibe, unless user set wind
   manually (manual always wins).

The **speed** asymmetry originally specified for step 3 is not used: across the whole
fixture corpus mean speed rises as the course turns *toward* the wind (a foil loses
apparent wind deep downwind), i.e. the opposite of the displacement-sailing rule it was
taken from. It is kept as a diagnostic only. The no-go-zone rule matches Garda's diurnal
pattern (morning Peler from N, afternoon Ora from S) on every corpus session.
Degenerate case: exactly opposed lobes (pure beam-reach out-and-back) put the true axis
perpendicular to the lobes where no bisector can find it — rejected, no estimate.

## Pump / takeoff detection

Watch (live, conservative): accel magnitude at `getMaxSampleRate()` (~25 Hz) → FIR band-pass
0.5–2.5 Hz → peak pick.

| param | default | units | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pumpBandLow` / `pumpBandHigh` | 0.5 / 2.5 | Hz | wing-pump stroke band |
| `pumpMinProminence` | TBD (lab) | m/s² | tune on wrist-accel corpus first |
| `pumpRefractory` | 400 | ms | max ~2.5 strokes/s |
| `pumpArmed` | OFF_FOIL only (watch) | | chop/arm-swing rejection; phone also analyzes in-flight pumping from raw accel |
| `attemptSuccessWindow` | 5 | s | ON_FOIL within this after last stroke ⇒ attempt succeeded |
| `attemptFailSilence` | 10 | s | no strokes for this ⇒ attempt failed |
| `freeTakeoff` | < 3 strokes | | flight with takeoff_pumps < 3 counts as "free" (enough wind) |

Phone metrics: pumps-to-takeoff, time-to-takeoff, cadence, HR cost (HR rise over attempt +30 s,
only over valid HR spans), attempts/successes, in-flight pump episodes (v2).

## Divergence check (phone, source class (a) only)

Banner when watch session fields vs phone recompute differ by: foil time > 5 % · any speed
record > 0.3 kn · flight/turn/attempt counts off by > 1. Divergences are tuning issues, not bugs
by definition — file them against the session fixture.
