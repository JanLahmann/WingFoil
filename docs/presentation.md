# Presentation contract — UI semantics all implementations follow

`algorithms.md` holds the parameters the three analysis implementations follow; this file
holds the *presentation* semantics the UIs follow. Two full implementations exist today —
the iOS app (SwiftUI) and the web app (inline SVG) — plus the watch's colour vocabulary,
and nothing but convention kept them aligned until this contract. The rule is the same as
for the engine: **semantics are defined once, here. An implementation that needs to deviate
changes this file first, in the same commit.**

Colour *values* live in `design/tokens.json`, which generates the Swift constants
(`DesignTokens`), `web/css/tokens.css` and `web/js/tokens.js` and is staleness-checked in CI
(`design/check_tokens.py --check`). A value is edited there and nowhere else; this file
defines the *meanings*.

## Layers

| id | shows | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flying` | track tinted on-foil | visible | phase tint, not a marker |
| `offFoil` | track tinted off-foil | visible | |
| `effort` | the selected GP3S record window glowing on track + shaded on chart | visible | window choice is the record picker's (below) |
| `flewThrough` | turn outcome markers, flew | visible | |
| `touchdown` | turn outcome markers, touchdown | visible | |
| `fellIn` | turn outcome markers, fell in | visible | |
| `courseChange` | rejected sweeps (bear-away / round-up) | visible | grey — a non-verdict |
| `pumping` | pump-burst spans on the track | visible | spans, not markers |
| `takeoff` | takeoff attempts, BOTH halves: successes and failures | visible | one chip hides both halves together |
| `splash` | submersion moments | visible | |
| `direction` | course-of-travel chevrons along the track | visible | decimated by on-screen spacing |

Layer visibility persists on iOS (hidden-set, `mapLayerVisibility.v1`; unknown ids must
decode harmlessly so old prefs survive new layers) and is transient on web. Legend chips are
the only toggle surface; a struck-through chip means hidden.

**Chip text is the layer catalogue's `label` in `design/tokens.json`** — flying · off foil ·
pumping · direction · flew through · touchdown · fell in · course change · takeoff · splash
— read from the generated constants on both platforms, never written as a literal in a view.
The one exception is `effort`, whose chip is labelled with the *selected* window ("best 2 s")
because that is what it is currently highlighting; the catalogue's "best effort" is the
fallback for a session with no achieved window.

## Colour and glyph vocabulary

**The outcome ladder is a verdict scale and nothing else may borrow it:**
green = flew through · orange = touchdown · red = fell in · grey = course change (no verdict).

**Fill carries the channel:** solid = a maneuver's outcome; hollow = a straight-line flight
end no turn explains. Same dot, same ladder, different fill.

**Effort-and-water layers sit deliberately outside the ladder** — nothing in them is a
verdict, and borrowing the ladder would make a takeoff look like a good jibe:
pumping = indigo (spans) · takeoff = blue (glyphs) · splash = cyan (drop glyph) ·
the selected record window = orange, one ink for both of its marks (the glow on the track
and the shading in the chart).

**Takeoff glyphs** (glyphs, not dots, so they can't be mistaken for outcomes on a busy
track): filled up-arrow = pumped takeoff ("this cost something") · hollow up-arrow = free
takeoff (wind alone) · **hollow red u-turn = failed attempt** — the one event in the effort
layers that *has* an outcome, so it alone borrows the ladder's red, and shape + fill carry
the distinction on two more channels for anyone who cannot use colour.

On sources without an accelerometer stream every takeoff renders as the filled (pumped)
arrow; free takeoffs cannot be distinguished without stroke counts. The engine reports
neither half of the split there (`freeTakeoffs` / `pumpedTakeoffs` are absent and every
takeoff carries `free: false`), so both apps draw the same arrow rather than inventing a
verdict about effort nobody measured.

**Phase tints** are one colour each, in both apps: flying = teal, off foil = the secondary
label grey. They are *not* the app's own accent blue — a track tinted with the brand colour
reads as chrome, and the flying tint has to be a category.

**Direction chevrons**: small, semi-transparent, oriented to travel, subordinate to every
marker — they indicate, never compete.

## Record windows

Eight kinds, in canonical order: `best2s, best10s, best5x10s, best100m, best250m, best500m,
bestNm, alpha500`. Default highlighted window: `best2s`. The picker: tapping a record
highlights *that* window on map and chart; tapping the selected one returns to the default;
selection is transient (never persisted); a record with no achieved window is inert and
says nothing.

## Marker eligibility

- Turns with `counted == false` are excluded from every marker, tally, list and trend.
- Pump episodes: only `success` and `failed` get markers. `recovery`, `in_flight` and
  `unknown` are counted where the analysis counts them but are **not** attempts and are
  never drawn.
- **Pumping spans = the `success` and `failed` episodes' `[startTs, endTs]`** — one span per
  attempt, both halves, on the track and as a chart band. Not one per *takeoff run*: that
  spelling drops every failed attempt, and the two counts differing between the platforms is
  precisely what the presentation goldens exist to catch (`pumpingSpans`).
- A straight-line flight end whose outcome is `glide_out` is the green end of the ladder and
  is counted under `flewThrough`, drawn hollow. There is no separate "glided out" layer or
  chip: fill carries the channel, colour carries the verdict, and a third category would say
  the same thing twice.
- Splash evidence comes from the engine's submersion flags (turns, flight ends); the UI
  never re-derives it.

## Filter semantics

Turn filters are type (`both | jibes | tacks`) × side (`both | port | starboard`), ANDed.
**Side means the ENTRY tack — the tack you came into the turn on — never the rotation
direction.** UI copy must say "Port entry / Starboard entry"; bare "left/right" is a
misread waiting to happen. Both turn fields exist in the schema (`side`, `direction`);
filters and trends read `side`.

## Formatter rules

- **A missing value is absent, never 0.** No dashes-grid where a whole card has nothing to
  say — the card does not render.
- Aggregates with a coverage carry it visibly ("23 of 23 takeoffs"); below the engine's
  `hrMinCoverage` the presentation warns (warning tone / banner), it does not hide.
- Rates with an empty denominator render empty, not "0%" — "0% ok" before the first turn
  reads as a verdict.
- A measured zero is a value ("0 bpm"), and "−0" must never appear.
- Speeds in the rider's unit (kn/km/h per settings); missing HR renders as the unit's
  missing form ("-- bpm"), not as zero.

## Scrub and zoom

- **One playhead.** The chart scrub position and the map dot are the same timestamp; moving
  either moves both. (iOS: `ReplayScrubber` shared state; web: the shared scrubber.)
- Chart zoom is a gesture on the time axis (iOS: pinch, because one-finger drag is the
  scrubber; web: wheel/pinch). While zoomed: scrubbing works within the window, a reset
  affordance is visible, the window's place in the session is indicated, and markers and
  shading outside the visible domain are not drawn.
- Zoom state is transient per session view.

## Enforcement

1. `design/tokens.json` + generated constants + a CI staleness check (bundle_lab-style) —
   colour/glyph values cannot drift silently.
2. Presentation goldens (`fixtures/presentation/*.expected.json`): per-fixture marker counts
   per layer, filter tallies and record-window sets, asserted by BOTH the Swift
   `PresentationTests` and the web verification scripts. A count that differs between
   platforms is a failing test, not a bug report.
